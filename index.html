							<h2>Myth #1: Vaccines Cause Autism</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>This has been disproven over and over again.</strong> A study done in 2013 isolated the antibody stimulating protiens (ASP) found in vaccines and cross referenced the vaccination records of 256 children with autism and 752 control children. By identifying what vaccines these children were receiving, they were able to see which protiens the children were exposed to in the following groups: 0-3 months, 0-7 months, 0-2 years.</p>
							<p>Using this information they found no connection to autism. All groups returned extremely similar percentages of autistic children and control children in the amount of ASPs administered.</p>
							<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Children were exposed to 0-6258 ASPs from ages 0-3 months, 0-9258 ASPs from ages 0-7 months, and 0-12258 ASPs from 0-2 years. In the charts below, you can see no significant correlation between ASP exposure and Autism as often speculated.</p>
